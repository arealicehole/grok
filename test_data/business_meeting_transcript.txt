Sarah: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining our Q4 planning meeting today, November 15th. I'm Sarah Chen, VP of Product, and we have John Martinez from Engineering and Lisa Wong from Marketing with us.

John: Thanks Sarah. Before we dive in, I wanted to update everyone on the API gateway project. We've made significant progress, but we're facing some challenges with the authentication system.

Lisa: That's actually perfect timing John, because our client Acme Corporation has been asking about enhanced security features for their integration.

Sarah: Great point Lisa. John, what specific challenges are we seeing with the authentication system?

John: The main issue is with OAuth 2.0 implementation. We're getting token refresh failures about 15% of the time. I think we need to redesign the token management system.

Lisa: How long would that take? Acme Corp is expecting a demo on December 10th, and TechFlow Solutions also wants to see the security improvements by end of Q4.

Sarah: That's a tight timeline. John, what's your realistic estimate for fixing the OAuth issues?

John: If I can get additional resources, maybe 3 weeks. But with current team capacity, I'd say 5-6 weeks minimum.

Sarah: Okay, I'm making a decision here. We'll bring in a contractor to help with OAuth implementation. Lisa, can you coordinate with Acme Corp to push their demo to December 20th?

Lisa: I'll reach out to their CTO, Mike Thompson, today. He's been understanding about timeline adjustments before.

John: That would be perfect. I'll also talk to our security consultant, Dr. Kim Park, about best practices for the token refresh mechanism.

Sarah: Excellent. Let's also schedule a checkpoint meeting for November 30th to review progress. Any other roadblocks we need to address?

Lisa: Just one thing - we need to finalize the API documentation for both Acme Corp and TechFlow Solutions. Their developers will need at least a week to review before implementation.

John: I can have the technical docs ready by December 1st if the OAuth fixes are on track.

Sarah: Perfect. So our action items are: John will work on OAuth fixes with contractor support, Lisa will reschedule Acme Corp demo to December 20th, and we'll reconvene November 30th for status update. Meeting adjourned.
