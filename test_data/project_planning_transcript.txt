Alex: Welcome to the kickoff meeting for Project Phoenix, our new customer analytics platform. I'm Alex Rodriguez, the project manager. Today we have Emma Chen from Data Engineering, Marcus Williams from Frontend, and Dr. Priya Patel from Data Science.

Emma: Thanks Alex. I've reviewed the initial requirements document, and we're looking at processing about 10 million customer interactions daily across web, mobile, and email channels.

Marcus: That's a significant data volume. What are we thinking for the user interface? Real-time dashboards or batch reporting?

Dr. Patel: From the analytics perspective, we need both. Real-time for monitoring and batch for deep insights. The machine learning models will require at least 6 months of historical data for training.

Alex: Good points. Let's break down the core requirements. Emma, what's needed for data infrastructure?

Emma: We'll need a streaming data pipeline using Apache Kafka, probably on AWS. For storage, I'm thinking S3 for raw data and Snowflake for the processed analytics warehouse. We'll also need Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

Marcus: For the frontend, we should build it in React with TypeScript. Real-time updates will require WebSocket connections, and we'll need a robust charting library like D3.js or Recharts.

Dr. Patel: The ML components will use Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. We'll need customer segmentation algorithms, churn prediction models, and recommendation engines.

Alex: Excellent. Now for timeline - the CEO wants a beta version for the board presentation on March 15th. Full production launch is targeted for June 1st.

Emma: March 15th for beta is aggressive but doable. I'd need the data pipeline completed by February 1st to allow time for testing and optimization.

Marcus: Frontend beta could be ready by February 15th if we focus on core dashboard functionality first. Advanced features can come in later iterations.

Dr. Patel: For ML models, I can have preliminary versions ready by February 20th, but they'll need continuous refinement based on real customer data.

Alex: What are the major risks we should be concerned about?

Emma: Data quality is my biggest concern. Customer data from legacy systems is often inconsistent. We might need 3-4 weeks just for data cleaning and standardization.

Marcus: Browser compatibility could be tricky with real-time features. Internet Explorer support might require significant additional development time.

Dr. Patel: Model accuracy depends heavily on data quality. If the data cleaning takes longer than expected, our ML performance could be compromised.

Alex: How about resource requirements?

Emma: I'll need two additional data engineers and access to cloud infrastructure budget of around $50,000 for the first year.

Marcus: Three frontend developers should be sufficient, plus one UI/UX designer for the dashboard design.

Dr. Patel: Two ML engineers and access to GPU instances for model training. Estimated cloud compute costs around $30,000 annually.

Alex: Alright, I'm documenting these requirements. Our next milestone review will be January 15th to assess progress on data pipeline and initial prototypes. Any final concerns?

Emma: We should also plan for GDPR compliance since we're handling customer data. That might add complexity to the data architecture.

Marcus: Accessibility standards are important too. We should ensure the dashboards work with screen readers and follow WCAG guidelines.

Dr. Patel: We'll need proper model versioning and A/B testing framework to measure ML model improvements over time.

Alex: Excellent points. I'll work with legal on compliance requirements and add accessibility to our frontend checklist. Meeting concluded.
