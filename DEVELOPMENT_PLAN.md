# Grok Intelligence Engine: Vibe-Driven Development Plan

## Project Overview

This is a **task-driven development plan** for building the Grok Intelligence Engine - a sophisticated AI-powered transcript analysis microservice that serves as the intelligence layer within the Jubal ecosystem. The project follows a **containerized, microservices architecture** with multi-step profile-based processing capabilities.

### Core Philosophy: Start Simple, Add One Feature at a Time

We'll build Grok using an iterative approach: starting with the simplest containerized "Hello World" and progressively adding intelligence capabilities while maintaining full test coverage at each step.

- [x] **Docker Desktop**: Installed and running
- [x] **Project Directory**: Created and initialized
- [x] **Archon MCP**: Project management system configured

### Initial Setup Commands
```bash
# Project already exists at /home/ice/dev/grok
cd /home/ice/dev/grok

# Verify Docker is running
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization & CLI Configuration ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Goals ✅
- ✅ Set up core development environment
- ✅ Configure essential CLIs for project management
- ✅ Initialize database and service registry

### Tasks ✅

#### 1.1 Configure Core CLIs ✅
**Objective**: Enable command-line management of project infrastructure
```bash
# GitHub CLI with OAuth authentication
gh auth login ✅

# Docker CLI verification
docker info ✅
```

#### 1.2 Initialize Supabase Environment ✅
**Objective**: Set up local development database
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if needed
npm install -g supabase ✅

# Initialize Supabase project
supabase init ✅

# Start local development environment (custom ports to avoid archon conflicts)
supabase start ✅
```
**Note**: Configured with custom ports (db: 54325, API: 54335, Studio: 54340) to avoid conflicts with Archon project.

#### 1.3 Set Up Redis Service Registry ✅
**Objective**: Prepare service discovery infrastructure
✅ **Using shared Jubal Redis infrastructure** (jubal-redis:6379) instead of separate container per team feedback.

**Completed Outputs**:
- ✅ Local Supabase running on custom ports
- ✅ Redis service registry connection configured (shared)
- ✅ GitHub repository connected and authenticated

---

## Phase 2: Application Scaffolding ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Goals ✅
- ✅ Create minimal, containerized backend service
- ✅ Implement basic Jubal service contracts
- ✅ Set up Docker orchestration

### Tasks ✅

#### 2.1 Scaffold the Backend Service ✅
**Objective**: Create FastAPI-based Grok adapter with basic endpoints

**Core Requirements ✅**:

- ✅ Health check endpoint (`GET /health`)
- ✅ Capabilities endpoint (`GET /capabilities`)
- ✅ Process endpoint (`POST /process`) with placeholder processing
- ✅ Profiles endpoints (`GET /profiles`, `GET /profiles/{id}`)
- ✅ Dockerfile for containerization

**Completed Structure**:
```
grok/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py              # FastAPI application ✅
│   ├── config.py            # Settings with pydantic-settings ✅
│   ├── models/              # Pydantic v2 models ✅
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── jubal.py         # Jubal service contracts ✅
│   │   └── profile.py       # Processing profile schemas ✅
│   └── services/            # Business logic ✅
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── registry.py      # Redis service registry ✅
│       └── processor.py     # Profile processor (placeholder) ✅

├── Dockerfile               # Single-stage production build ✅
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies ✅
├── docker-compose.yml       # Service orchestration ✅
└── .env.example            # Environment template ✅
```

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility (`BaseSettings` import, `field_validator`)
- ✅ Resolved field naming conflict (`error` field vs `error()` method)
- ✅ Updated to use `pydantic-settings` package

#### 2.2 Implement Service Registration ✅
**Objective**: Auto-register with Redis service registry

**Key Features ✅**:
- ✅ Redis connection on startup with shared jubal-redis
- ✅ Service metadata registration
- ✅ Health status updates
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Startup/shutdown lifecycle management

#### 2.3 Create Docker Orchestration ✅
**Objective**: Manage services with docker-compose

**Services Configured ✅**:
- ✅ `grok-adapter`: Main application service (port 8002)
- ✅ Uses external `jubal-network` for service communication
- ✅ Connects to shared `jubal-redis` service registry
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

**Test Results ✅**: `docker compose up` successfully starts service

**Verification Tests ✅**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/health          # ✅ Service health check
curl http://localhost:8002/capabilities    # ✅ Jubal capabilities
curl http://localhost:8002/profiles        # ✅ Available profiles
